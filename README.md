# seagate-blackarmor-nas

## Preamble
Some years ago [I reverse engineered](seagate-blackarmor-nas.txt) the Seagate Blackarmor NAS 220 and found a convenient way on [how to enable SSH on the device](sg2000-2000.1337.sp42.img). Later, the same mechanism was used to install an [alternative Linux firmware (Debian 5 Lenny)](custom-sg2000-2000.1337.sp99.img). Obviously, Debian 5 Lenny has reached end of life and should not be used in production anymore. 

## Debian 10 Buster

Evgeni Dobrev created a [kernel patch to include hardware support for the Blackarmor 220 in the mainline linux kernel](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/529020/) and Moritz Rosenthal has released detailed docs on [how to update the system with an up-to-date linux kernel and Debian distribution](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian). I used their work to create some (hopefully) helpful scripts which streamline the process a little further.

With the following instructions you'll manage to install a fully updateable Debian 10 Buster system to the NAS (kernel and initrd stored in NAND flash, updated via [flash-kernel package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/flash-kernel)).

(It's still possible to install Debian 9 Stretch by changing `DEBDIST=buster` to `DEBDIST=stretch` in `blackarmor-nas220-debian-prep.sh`)

### Warning

This completely removes the Seagate firmware and bootloader -- and there is no easy way of going back. There is a risk of bricking your device, especially if the u-boot bootloader does not start. You have been warned.

This script has been tested on the Blackarmor NAS 220. [At the time of writing it is unclear if it works for the NAS 110 or NAS 440 as well](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/issues/5).

### Prerequisites

Setup a serial terminal (`115200 baud 8N1` e.g. by using `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`) by connecting a 3.3V serial cable to connector `CN5` pins 1=TX, 4=RX and 6=GND like this:

![Blackarmor NAS220 serial port](https://github.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/blob/master/blackarmor-nas220-debian-serialport.jpg "serial port")

### Preparing kernel and initrd images

Use your favourite Linux workstation to execute [`blackarmor-nas220-debian-prep.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas220-debian-prep.sh) to download and prepare Das U-Boot bootloader and kernel image:

```
$ ./blackarmor-nas220-debian-prep.sh 
Using kernel 4.9.0-8 for installation.

Execute the following commands on the Blackarmor NAS:

usb start
fatload usb 0:1 0x800000 u-boot.kwb
nand erase 0x0 0x87200
nand write 0x800000 0x0 0x87200
fatload usb 0:1 0x800000 u-boot-env.bin
nand erase 0xA0000 0x10000
nand write 0x800000 0xA0000 0x10000
```

Copy the files `u-boot.kwb`, `u-boot-env.bin`, `uImage-dtb` and `uInitrd` from directory `blackarmor-nas220-debian` to a FAT formatted USB stick. Carefully examine the flash commands shown at the end of the script output.

### Flashing Das U-Boot bootloader

This step is only necessary for the very first installation or if you're upgrading from Debian 9 Stretch to Debian 10 Buster. If you're updating within the same Debian release or re-installing, directly skip to [Starting Debian installation](#Starting-Debian-installation).

Use the serial terminal to stop the Seagate boot process and to show the ethernet MAC address:

Write down the MAC adress, you'll need it later. Connect the USB stick to port 1 of the NAS and flash the new bootloader (enter `usb start ... nand write` commands exactly as shown during preparation phase):

```

```

Make sure to restart the NAS via `reset` command after flashing the bootloader!

If your nas just restarts with the error message `cpu reset` after the `fatload usb 0:1 0x800000 u-boot.kwb` command try to format the usb stick to `ext2` and use `ext2load usb 0:1 ...` instead. 

### Starting Debian installation

After resetting the NAS, connect a network cable to the NAS and execute `run bootcmd_usb` to start the Debian netboot installation:

Proceed with Debian installation as usual (configure RAID, select packages, ...). Ignore the `No installable kernel was found` and `No boot loader installed` warnings (`Continue without installing a kernel?`=`Yes` and `Continue`), but do not reboot yet! Don't forget the `Finish installation` item last or you won't be able to login later.

### Finishing Debian installation

Before rebooting the installation system (the `Installation complete` screen appears) select the `Go Back` button. Select `Execute a shell` (second last option in main menu) and chroot to the target system:

```
# mount -o bind /proc /target/proc
# mount -o bind /sys /target/sys
# chroot /target
# cd /tmp
```

Download and execute [`blackarmor-nas220-debian-postinstall.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas220-debian-postinstall.sh) like this:

```
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/seagate-blackarmor-nas/master/blackarmor-nas220-debian-postinstall.sh
# chmod +x blackarmor-nas220-debian-postinstall.sh

Set ethernet MAC address and enable autoboot (only needed after flashing Das U-Boot bootloader):

```
# fw_setenv ethaddr 00:10:75:42:42:42
# exit
# exit
```

Exit the shell, remove USB stick and reboot the system via the Debian installer main menu.

### Additional tuning

- As Moritz [suggests](http://wiki.ccc-ffm.de/projekte:diverses:seagate_blackarmor_nas_220_debian#tuning) it is advisable to install the `lm-sensors` and `hdparm` packages. 

- He also notes that you can adjust the fan speed by echo-ing the desired speed to sysfs: `echo 128 > /sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-0/device/0-002e/pwm1`.
